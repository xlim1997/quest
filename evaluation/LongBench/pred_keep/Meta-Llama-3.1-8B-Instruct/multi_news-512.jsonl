Researchers at the University of California, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, have conducted two separate studies to investigate the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA.\n\nAccording to the first study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, cigarette smoke extract of cigarette smoke was found to stress MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, making it more resistant to the immune system's immune system. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.\n\nThe second study, also led by Dr. Crotty Alexander, found that cigarette smoke exposure caused MRSA to become more aggressive and resistant to antibiotics, while e-cigarette vapor had a lesser effect. The study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures and caused more mice to die.\n\nThe researchers suggest that cigarette smoke may be making the primary cause of disease not by harming the smoker, but by making the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for this alternative. The study was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe findings of these studies are alarming and alarming and have significant implications for public health.

However, each Wikipedia edition highlighted localizes its own historical figures, with most being born in the countries that use the language of the edition.\n\nThe researchers used Google's PageRank algorithm, which measures a method that still used by the search engine to decide the importance of web pages in its index. However, when applied to Wikipedia, the results were odd, with Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, emerging as the most important person in the world. This was due to the fact that Wikipedia's quirk of containing an almost complete collection of named species, and Linnaeus' life work was coming up with a system to classify organisms.\n\nTo get around this issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, and health officials are concerned that the rising number of cases could foretell a repeat of the repeat of 2014, when 120 cases were reported.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and is caused by viral infections, including polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. The exact trigger is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**Symptoms of AFM**\n\nSymptoms include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. The latter symptom can require urgent ventilator support. Most patients with AFM have been children, with an average age of 7, but some cases have been reported in adults.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThe CDC advises people are advised to prevent illness by washing hands with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant, especially those that a sick person has touched. There are no vaccines for this strain of enterovirus, so doctors urge good hygiene as the best defense.\n\n**Research Efforts to Study of EV-D68**\n\nResearch is ongoing to study the virus, with the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and Children's Hospital Colorado, noted a cluster of cases of acute limb weakness among children.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the bloodstain patterns on the cloth are inconsistent with a crucified man, leading researchers to conclude that it may be a medieval forgery.\n\nThe researchers, Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University, and Luigi Garlaschelli, an organic chemist, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to analyze the Shroud. They tested the orientation of stains on the cloth by pumping blood samples on a model at wound points depicted on the shroud. The results showed that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, chest, and back.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the Shroud are inconsistent with a person on a cross, as they would have left a distinct blood pattern on the cloth. The study found that the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that the conclusions were based on body parts held in a fixed position, rather than accounting for carrying a body, cleaning a body, or preparing a body for burial.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

In Moldova, there has seen a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since 2007, despite being the poorest country in Europe.

International donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their funding and the principles they promote greatly influence the support available to children and families.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign aims to raise awareness and create a global movement to end the practice of institutionalization.

The dinosaur's remains were found to have iridescent feathers that may have glittered with the colors of the rainbow. The melanosomes, which are pigment sacs, were found in the feathers, indicating that the dinosaur's head and chest were covered with iridescent feathers, similar to those of modern hummingbirds.\n\nCaihong juji had a bird-like body that more closely resembled that of a Velociraptor, with a crested head and a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur was a small carnivore that weighed roughly a pound and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji suggests that dinosaurs may have used their feathers originally evolved for display, only later taking on the traits needed for flight. The discovery of Caihong juji is the oldest known animal to have this key adaptation of asymmetrical feathers, which would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. The iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx also has asymmetrical feathers, but it lived ten million years later.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji also suggests that feathers may have been used for showing off, notes University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, who reviewed the study before publication.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from over 64,000 children and found that about half of the mothers reported taking acetaminophen during pregnancy.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, emphasized that the findings do not mean that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen, but rather that they should avoid taking it frequently until more studies have been done. Dr. Ritz also noted that the study did not find a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen and ADHD.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with a growing a larger body of research that suggests that acetaminophen may have a hormone-like effect on the developing fetus.

The study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that nearly 15% of them were under 50.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, but they were also more likely to undergo aggressive treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy. In fact, 72% of younger patients underwent surgery compared to 63% of older patients. Younger patients also received radiation therapy more often, at 53% compared to 48%.\n\nDespite the more aggressive disease, younger patients tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The five-year survival rate for patients under 50 was 95.1% for localized tumors, 76% for regional disease, and 21.3% for distant disease.\n\nExperts are calling the study's findings a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community to be on the lookout for signs of colorectal cancer in patients under 50. Dr. Samantha Hendren, the study's lead author, said that doctors should be on the lookout for symptoms such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon. Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, said that these symptoms are often ignored by patients or doctors.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are not yet clear, but experts. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that it may be due to environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet.\n\nThe study's findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age. Dr. Hendren said that it would be a big and costly change, and that more research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The discovery was discovered by chance when a colleague of archaeologist Giles Hamm needed a toilet break and stumbled upon a rock shelter with a blackened roof, indicating human activity.\n\nThe site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, has yielded a treasure trove of artefacts and fossils and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile.

The site also provided reliably dated evidence of hafted axe technology about 38,000 years ago. The evidence dates cohabitation with megafauna, with the discovery of bones from the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird.\n\nThe study suggests that humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than we thought, with the discovery of ancient artefacts in a South Australian cave that have been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago.

{"pred": "**Scientists Explore the Possibility of Advanced Alien Civilizations Harvesting Energy from Stars**\n\nA recent paper by physicist Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that advanced civilizations may be harvesting energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from being left behind as the universe expands. This idea is based on the concept of the Kardashev scale, which measures the energy consumption of a civilization. According to the scale, a Type I civilization harnesses all the resources of a planet, a Type II civilization harnesses all the radiation of a star, and a Type III civilization harnesses all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nHooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy before they become inaccessible. This would be done using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which would hover around a star, beaming energy back to a nearby planet. The paper proposes that these satellites would be detectable as a result of the propulsion that they are currently undergoing, which would produce significant fluxes of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and was later popularized by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\". The idea of megastructures has since been featured in various forms in science fiction, including in the novel \"Ringworld\" by Larry Niven and the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".\n\nThe idea of harvesting energy from stars is not just a theoretical concept, but a necessary for ancient extraterrestrial civilizations, millions of years older than humanity, who would need enormous amounts of energy.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

This challenges the long-held view that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly arose 40,000-50,000 years ago, known as the \"human revolution.\" \n\nThe new evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin suggests that human populations adapted technologically and culturally and culturally to the environment, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. The team found distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area, suggesting technological innovation had taken place.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the government has been accused of wrongdoing without being charged, resulting in millions of dollars in business losses.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end-users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with US and Malagasy law.\n\nThe raids on Gibson's facilities in Tennessee and Memphis are not the first time the first time the company has faced such an issue. In 2009, agents seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar. The company's attorney claims that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also has also affected the guitar industry, with some manufacturers and dealers expressing concerns about the law's retroactive nature. The law requires owners to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the US, including vintage instruments.

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

The disease is caused by a virus that affects the brain and spinal cord, and if left untreated, it is almost always fatal.\n\n**Attack in Hope**\n\nOn June 3, 2017, 21-year-old Rachel Borch was attacked by a victim of a rabid raccoon while jogging on a trail near her home. The raccoon, which was acting strangely and aggressively, latched onto her thumb, causing her to scream and cry. In a desperate attempt to defend herself, Borch used her strength to push the raccoon into a nearby puddle of muddy puddle, holding its head underwater until it stopped struggling. The raccoon was later confirmed to have tested positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control and the animal was retrieved by Borch's father.\n\n**Attack in Topsham**\n\nEarlier this week, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands by what was believed to be a rabid fox in Topsham. The incident highlights the risk of rabies in the state, with 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes, and skunks, testing positive for rabies in 2017.\n\n**Rabies in Maine**\n\nAccording to the Maine CDC, rabies is a common disease in most parts of the country, including Maine. In 2016, 64 animals in Maine tested positive for rabies, and the disease is 100% fatal if left untreated. The Maine CDC warns that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it's almost 100% certain there are other animals in the area also infected.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nBorch, who is expected to receive her last of four rabies shots on Saturday, has been taking antibiotics for the puncture wounds on her hands.

When the raccoon finally stopped moving, she yanked out her finger and raced the three-quarters of a mile home. Two days later, the state confirmed the animal was infected with rabies.

{"pred": "**Mars Was Once a Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nNew research from NASA scientists has revealed that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its surface. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in places, lasted for millions of years and was a significant enough to provide a habitable environment for life to emerge and thrive.\n\nThe study of the Martian atmosphere, conducted by a team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, revealed that the planet's water vapor contains a higher proportion of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, than Earth's ocean. This is because Mars' weaker gravity has allowed ordinary hydrogen to leak into space over time, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium. By calculating the escape rates of water loss, the scientists estimated that the ancient ocean would have covered the depth of about 137 meters if it had covered the entire planet evenly.\n\nHowever, it is believed that the water would have pooled into a much deeper ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a consistently lower altitude. The scientists also suggest that the early Martian atmosphere was rich in heavy hydrogen, which would have skewed any calculations based on today's values.\n\nThe findings are significant as they provide evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, which would have been more hospitable to life to support the notion that life might once have existed on Mars. The study also suggests that the ancient ocean would have been a major factor in the evolution of life on the planet, and that the longer water persists on a planetary body in one location, the more likely it is to provide a habitable environment for life to either originate or proliferate.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of the search for life on Mars, which will ramp up in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has sent the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) back to review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. The ruling was made after the ECJ dismissed appeals by both companies.\n\nThe case began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of a KitKat, which was granted in 2006. However, Mondelez, the maker of Cadbury, argued that the company had fought against the trademark, and the case has been ongoing for over a decade. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets.\n\nThe dispute has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The case has also featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree's, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988.\n\nThe ruling means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit.

According to a study published in the journal Evolution journal Evolution journal Evolution, closed-mouth vocalizations, which are sounds emitted through the skin in the skin in the neck area while the beak is kept closed, are common in birds and may have been present in some extinct nonavian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, said that closed-mouth vocalizations are often much quieter and lower in pitch, and are usually used by birds to attract mates or defend their territory. The researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's co-author, Chad Eliason, a postdoctoral researcher at The University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences, said that the association with large bodies is a matter of physics. The inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge, and the lung pressure required to inflate a cavity depends on the tension in the wall of the cavity, and this tension increases for smaller body sizes.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs. As in birds, this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and hence would have co-occurred with open-mouthed vocalizations.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Despite extensive search efforts to locate the plane have been ongoing, the mystery of its disappearance remains unsolved. However, statistical analysis has been used to inform the search efforts, drawing on the expertise of Bayesian statisticians.\n\n**A Successful Application of Bayesian Statistics**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 went missing, and a plane debris was found five days later. However, the search for the rest of the plane was challenging due to unpredictable ocean currents. A team of statisticians from Metron Inc. in Virginia, led by Colleen Keller, was called in contact with the French aviation accident investigation authority, BEA. They used Bayesian statistics to assess the French BEA's theories for why the aircraft might have crashed, and the results of the searches that had already been carried out. They also applied Bayesian statistics to work out the most likely location of the plane.\n\n**The Power of Bayesian Probability Maps**\n\nThe team split up the search area into a grid and applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there. The probability map provided by Keller gave a much tighter area to search. A team went out there, hoping that finally the mystery would be solved. However, those hopes were dashed. Some months later, though, Air France got back in touch and asked Keller to make one last attempt to analyze the data. This time, she and her colleagues decided they were not happy with one of their initial assumptions. The historical data showed that after a crash, the black box will be emitting a signal in 90% of cases. However, in the immediate aftermath of the search teams had spent a lot of time sweeping the areas close to the last known location, listening for the ping of the black box or voice recorder. They had heard nothing. So Keller and her team had decided there was a very low probability the plane would be found there. But what if neither the black box nor the voice recorder were sending a signal? The Metron statisticians now adapted their model to this possible scenario and came up with a new area of highest probability. A team returned to the scene to look - and this time they found the plane.\n\n**The Mystery of MH370**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is complicated by the new estimates of the plane's location, mounting evidence that a deliberate act caused the disappearance", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."], "all_classes": null, "length": 716}
