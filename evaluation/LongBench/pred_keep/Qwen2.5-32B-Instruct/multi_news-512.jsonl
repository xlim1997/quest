The cloth has been a subject of intense scrutiny and debate for centuries, with radiocarbon dating in the 1980s placing its origin between 1260 and 1390 CE, indicating a medieval fabrication during the time of the Crusades.\n\nA new forensic study published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences by researchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, used real and synthetic blood samples to analyze the bloodstain patterns on the cloth. The researchers found that the bloodstain patterns on the cloth are inconsistent with any single pose, suggesting that the cloth was likely created using a standing models in different positions rather than a crucified man or a corpse laid flat.\n\nThe investigation involved seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. The researchers found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For instance, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe researchers also found that the simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The dinosaur had a Velociraptor-like head with prominent eyebrow-like crests, suggesting it was used for display. The dinosaur was a small, with a small carnivore weighing about a pound, and had feathers that could have been well-pennaceous and fuzzy. The discovery of Caihong provides insight into the evolution of feathers and coloration in dinosaurs and the early development of birds, including the earliest known asymmetrical tail feathers.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

{"pred": "Summary:\n\nThe U.S. government is on the brink of a potential partial shutdown due to a fiscal standoff between Congress and the White House over funding for federal agencies and conditions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The House of Representatives, led by Speaker John Boehner, has approved a plan to fund federal funding federal agencies through December 15, with conditions including a one-year delay in ACA implementation and repeal of the medical device tax. However, Senate Democrats in the Senate, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, have vowed to reject any amendments to the health law, setting up a confrontation that could lead to a shutdown.\n\nReid's strategy is to avoid making concessions on the short-term funding bill to prevent a shutdown, believing that Republicans will demand more significant concessions on the debt ceiling. Democrats are unified in their stance against any changes to the ACA, with the White House and Reid planning to make the case that the burden is on Republicans to pass a clean bill to keep the government funded.\n\nThe potential shutdown could have significant economic impact on the Washington D.C. region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors. Local economist Stephen Fuller projects that a shutdown could cost the region $200 million a day and affect over 7000,000 jobs. Services such as new applications for Medicare, Social Security, housing loans, and small business loans could be halted. The shutdown could also impact tourism, with the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo, and Civil War battlefields closed.\n\nLocal governments are preparing for the shutdown by setting aside funds to mitigate the loss of revenue from federal workers. The situation remains tense, with both sides are the last-minute negotiations to avert a shutdown.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

This trend is expected to continue, with projections indicating that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in ten colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50.\n\nThe studies also revealed that younger patients under 50 were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease, where cancer had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this is partly attributed to the fact that younger patients often only receive a diagnosis after the cancer after symptoms such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon become apparent.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

However, new excavations reveal tools and trading networks and the use of pigments dating back 320,000 years.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

This revelation has led to increased scrutiny of Manafort's role in the Trump campaign, especially as the U.S. election cycle's focus rests on the region.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump has announced plans to end nation-building and replace it with foreign policy realism focused on destroying the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations. He also plans to propose a new immigration policy that would stop issuing visas in cases where adequate screenings can't be performed and create a new, ideological test for admission to assess stances on issues like religious freedom.\n\nIn response, Vice President Joe Biden, who is set to hold his first campaign rally for Clinton, has declared Trump the most uninformed presidential nominee in history. Biden will argue that Trump is less prepared on national security than any previous nominee and that his rhetoric and \"bluster\" will make Pennsylvanians and Americans less safe.

The high deuterium enrichment in certain regions of Mars, particularly near the polar caps, further supports the prolonged and substantial presence of water on the planet.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, may have produced low, throaty sounds similar to those of large-bodied birds like ostriches and cassowaries. These closed-mouth vocalizations, or \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" occur when birds push air into an esophageal pouches, creating resonant, low-frequency sounds. This behavior has been observed in 52 out of 208 bird species studied, predominantly among larger-bodied species, suggesting it evolved independently at least 16 times within the archosaur group, which includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Evolution, indicates that dinosaurs, being members of the archosaur group, likely had the capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations. This behavior may have been limited to mating displays, implying that dinosaurs could have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds during such displays. This paints a very different picture of the Jurassic world, where dinosaurs were not only feathered but also potentially made sounds far quieter and more mellow than previously imagined.\n\nIn contrast, the sound design of \"Jurassic Park\" relied heavily on a mixtures of various animal sounds to create the iconic roars and hisses of the film's dinosaurs. For instance, the T. rex roar was crafted from a concoction of baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and gargling alligator sounds, while the raptors' vocalizations included elements from mating tortoises and angry geese.
