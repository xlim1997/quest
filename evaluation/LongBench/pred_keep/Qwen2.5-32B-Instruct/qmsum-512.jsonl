{"pred": "The discussion about selecting channels highlighted a few key points. Most people generally, users tend to use only a few channels, but they still enjoy the functionality to zap through many channels. The team considered implementing a feature that allows users could allow users to directly input channel numbers, rather than going through the zap function of zapping through hundreds of channels. However, the team also noted that they should keep the design simple and intuitive, and not to overcomplicate the remote control with too many functions.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels. However, in the Marketing's previous presentation, some people did love zapping, so the user interface designer suggested carrying out some research to find out how many people really needed to skip from one channel to another."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7338}

{"pred": "The meeting began with introductions and some technical issues, leading to a kick-off meeting for a new television remote control project. The Project Manager outlined the project's goals, including designing a remote that is a new, trendy, and user-friendly design, particularly for young people. The team discussed the importance of compatibility with other devices, ease of use, and the need for multi-functionality, and the shape and form of the remote. They also touched on material considerations and the need for a universal remote that works across different brands. The meeting concluded with plans for further research and development, including customizable customization options, and the next steps for individual tasks. The team agreed to reconvene in thirty minutes for further discussions.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro.

Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6381}
{"pred": "Kirsty Williams acknowledged that there is still a challenge in recruiting teachers, particularly for secondary school training, as they are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of their targets. She noted that this is not a uniquely Welsh issue, or even a UK problem, but an international issue, as evidenced by significant teacher shortages in systems in the USA, Australia, and Finland. To address this, they have taken several steps including ensuring that their Initial Teacher Education (ITE) provision is world-class, offering financial incentives for graduates with high qualifications in priority subjects, and embarking on a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. They also set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff to understand the issues better and suggest further actions.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13883}
